# Capstone Project: Gauging NHL Player Value

## Introduction

Over the course of the last 15 to 20 years, statistics and probability have fundamentally changed the world of professional sports. This statistical 'revolution' is romanticized in the movie "Moneyball," based on Michael Lewis' book of the same name. In the film, set in 2002, the General Manager of the MLB Oakland Athletics, Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) teams up with Peter Brand, a fictitious Yale economics graduate major that is based on the real life assistant GM at the time, Paul DePodesta (played by Jonah Hill) to radically alter how the Oakland A's assess player value. In order to compete with MLB teams that have much larger player payrolls, Beane and DePodesta had to find players that were undervalued by the standard collective wisdom of baseballs' scouts, managers, and coaches. As such, they had to apply a new method of evaluating player value.  

They defied commonly followed baseball stats, and the intuition of their scouts, and started to use sabermetrics. Roughly defined, sabermetrics is an empirical analysis of in-game activity. Through advanced statistical analysis, certain indicators (on-base percentage, slugging percentage, etc.) were determined to be better predictors of offensive success than the 'standard' stats (batting avg, stolen bases, etc.). Focusing on these stats, Beane and his staff were able to acquire players that were atypical and undervalued. It helped the Oakland A's to set a 20-game win streak, and successfully compete with franchises with significantly larger payrolls (Yankees, Red Sox, etc.) than themselves. Since then, using sabermetrics has become a pillar of valuing players in Major League Baseball.

Beane and DePondesta effectively changed the landscape of evaluating professional baseball players. A very similar change is occurring in the National Hockey League, albeit late to the table in comparison to the other major sports, it has gained a lot of traction in the last few years. Especially during the 2014-15 season, when the NHL partnered with SAP to create an enhanced statistical package that matched up with launch of a new website featuring advanced analytics. This also coincided with several prominent NHL franchises adding data analytics positions to their front office including Kyle Dubas (Toronto Maple Leafs), Tyler Dellow (Edmonton Oilers), and Sunny Mehta (New Jersey Devils). Since then, it has really taken off.

## The Greatest Game on Earth.

Parity is at all time high in the NHL. When the trade deadline rolls around in late February, many teams still fancy themselves in the hunt for the Stanley Cup. To add to that effect, ever since the LA Kings won the Cup in 2012 as an 8 seed (and went 16-4 no less), many teams believe the whole mantra of "you just have to make it to the playoffs, and then anything can happen."

This inevitably leads to a glut of 'buyers' (teams looking to pickup players to increase their chances of winning) at the trade deadline, but not nearly as many 'sellers' (teams that want to get of rid of players for future draft picks or young prospects). This, in conjunction with the salary cap that I'll discuss later, means finding undervalued players is a quintessential way to try to gain an edge come playoff time.

My hope is that I am able to find the best statistics to understand player value vs how much that player makes.

Which leads me to my data science question: Can you build a model to predict NHL player's salaries? What are the best predictors of how much a player will make?

If I can find undervalued players, that would ideally help a general manager make decisions on who to try to acquire.
